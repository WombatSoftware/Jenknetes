# Jenknetes - Jenkins slaves made for a K8s world

## Goal
We have seen some Docker based Jenkins slave images but none were ready to use with dind (Docker-in-Docker).

We wanted to use dind because we want:

* Image isolation between the host system and the built container - donÂ´t trash the host system
* Reproducable image builds - Docker version should not depend on the version installed on the host system

## Getting started
We started using the link:https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Kubernetes+Plugin[Kubernetes Plugin] to configure a Jenkins cloud running in our K8s cluster.
This cloud deploys Docker based Jenkins slaves dynamically as soon as a new job starts.

Here you can find a sample configuration using the dind-1.11 image:

The `Label` inside the `Kubernetes Pod Template` can later be used in the `Jenkinsfile` as the node name.

### Docker images

Currently we have 2 running images and we are happy if you share your experiences and help us improve them or create new ones:

* Docker-in-Docker 1.11 + Jenkins Slave: `quay.io/jenknetes/slave-dind-1.11`
* Docker-in-Docker 1.12 + Jenkins Slave: `quay.io/jenknetes/slave-dind-1.12`
